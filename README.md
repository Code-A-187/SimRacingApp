# SimRacingApp
Django project for Softuni Django Advanced course

That is Django framework based project. It is inspired from my passion of racing and in particular Sim racing. The idea is to create social network that can connect Simracing enthusiasts from all over the world. No metter if they are passionate about sim world of drift, rally, track racing, oval racing etc. this soccial place is for them.
They will share ideas, experiences with video and pictures. Also achievements in different simulators( iRacing, ACC, RichardBurnsRally etc.), may be also their sim rigs and the hardware they use.
